##H2 The Hong Kong Food Market is the most peacful place of all Hong Kong... until the last mango of the season remains. The last mango produced by the suppliers of the Hong Kong
Food Market is THE GOLDEN MANGO. THE GOLDEN MANGO is the most desired fruit of all Hong Kong, and when all remains is THE GOLDEN MANGO, men start to turn on eachother and they will
fight to eternal sleep just for the posession of the mango.
